Revision history for XML-Entity-HTML

{{$NEXT}}
    - Completely rewite internal logic so that the mapping is
      generated once at compile time.
    - Rewrite the build script so that we get some easier browsable
      code and can write the non-generated bits in the module file.
    - First version in zef ecosystem
