# Extension of XML::Entity for (X)HTML 5 entities.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/supernovus/xml-entity-html.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/supernovus/xml-entity-html)

## Introduction

It's simply an extension class of XML::Entity, but with a lot more entities
taken from the [official JSON list](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json).

Any entities that wouldn't compile properly have been blacklisted and aren't
supported. See the build/ directory for the script I used to build the library.
